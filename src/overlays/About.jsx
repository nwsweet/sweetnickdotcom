          Hi, I'm Nick Sweet. I like to build and make and create and design. 
          I work as an embedded software engineer for small microcontroller devices used in automotive settings.
          This website exists mostly as a pet project to collect and document the things I create outside of my professional life.
          That usually consists of modifying my BMW wagon, building bikes, sharing photos I take and music I make, and any other creative explorations.
          I built this website to be able to share the things that interest me while being less reliant on  social media, and as an effort to learn some web development. 
          Take a look around, explore my photos, github, blog posts, whatever.If you have something to say leave a post it note, send me an email, or write it down and throw it away.
        </p>
